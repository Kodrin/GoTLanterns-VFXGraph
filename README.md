VFX graph sample in HDRP of the water lanterns in Ghost of Tsushima. The sample is mainly meant to educate people on how to VFX graph to create believable in-game effects that can interact with the player. The graph is fully commented and organized so hopefully you should be able to just open it and read through it.
